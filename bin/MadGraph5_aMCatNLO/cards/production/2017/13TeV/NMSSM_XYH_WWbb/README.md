Contains CMS Madgraph cards for X to YH samples, with Y decaying to WW and H to bb. Both Y and X masses vary, but the Higgs mass is constant at 125 GeV.

The script `generate_grid.py` will generate the folders for each `(mX, mY)` generator mass point. After this, everything should be ready for gridpack generation.
